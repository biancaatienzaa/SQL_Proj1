# SQL_Proj1
SQL School Project including python to extract and manipulate data from given database file. 
Wasn't able to upload database given, but given skeleton code for main and a project description to produce certain output using the large database file to extract needed data and information to properly sort and display the output in the PDF. 

In main.py, import matlab to visually show the plot graph of results for commands 8 and 9. There are 9 total commands, each with a different purpose to show a certain output. The user is prompted with instructions and each command shows multiple inputs and will extract various data. 

*missing CTA database file in which the code extracts data from, too large.
